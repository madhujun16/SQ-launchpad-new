Cursor/UX Rules for SmartQ Launchpad
1. Contextual Interactivity: Edit vs. View State
description:
Cursor should change to pointer over actionable elements (buttons, editable fields, icons). Show text cursor over editable fields only when in Edit mode; default to arrow cursor for read-only fields.
globs:
*.btn, *.icon-edit, *.editable, [role='button'], .form-field.editable
alwaysApply: True

2. Visual Feedback on Save/Transition
description:
Show a progress spinner or subtle animation on Save actions, with a temporary cursor change to indicate action in progress. After save, revert to default and show a success indicator for updated fields.
globs:
*.btn-save, *.btn-complete
alwaysApply: True

3. Mobile Responsiveness
description:
Ensure all cursor states work seamlessly for mobile/touch—replace cursor changes with touch states (highlight, elevation, shadow, tap feedback) for inputs, buttons, and cards.
globs:
body, .form-container, .btn, .card, .modal
alwaysApply: True

4. Accessibility & Feedback
description:
Cursor should always indicate disabled/non-actionable states for role-restricted or inactive elements. Use “not-allowed” cursor for disabled fields, off buttons, or steps blocked by workflow.
globs:
*.disabled, *.locked, .role-restricted, [aria-disabled='true']
alwaysApply: True

5. Navigation & Step Progress
description:
Navigation buttons (“Previous”, “Next”, phase selectors, dashboards) use pointer cursor and mild hover animation. Progress bars/steppers show pointer if clickable, else default.
globs:
*.btn-nav, *.progress-stepper
alwaysApply: True

6. Notes & Collaborative Features
description:
Interactive site notes icons/popups trigger pointer cursor and tap animation; editable notes use text cursor in mobile and desktop.
globs:
*.site-notes, *.popup-edit-note
alwaysApply: True

7. Table & Dashboard Actions
description:
All actions/icons in dashboard cards, tables, and lists use pointer cursor. Editable table cells switch to text cursor on activation.
globs:
*.dashboard-actions, .table-action, .list-action
alwaysApply: True

8. Animation for Edit, Save, and Transitions
description:
Editable form sections transition with a slide/fade animation and mild elevation effect on cursor hover or activation, supporting microinteractions. Show “Done” pulse after save.
globs:
.form-edit-section, *.btn-save, *.edit-transition
alwaysApply: True

9. Theme Consistency
description:
Cursor color/effects, if used, should harmonize with SmartQ’s current gradient (black-to-green pre-login and inverted green post-login) and light palette, respecting high contrast for accessibility.
globs:
body, header, nav, .card, .btn
alwaysApply: True

10. Tooltip/Info Elements
description:
Cursor for tooltips, info icons, audit trail views use pointer and gentle hover effect for clarity.
globs:
*.tooltip, *.info, *.audit-trail
alwaysApply: True

UX Extras:

Be sure every clickable element is visually distinct—add subtle shadow/elevation or opacity change on hover/click.

On mobile, clickable elements should expand slightly on tap.

Success/failure toasts use color and mild vibration (if supported on device).

If a step is completed, add a checkmark pulse or glow to the progress indicator.
